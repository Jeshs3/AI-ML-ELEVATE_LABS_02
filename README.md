TASK 02
This guide provides simple steps to perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset. 
It helps you understand your data and uncover patterns before building models.

Steps
1. Summary Statistics
Calculate metrics like mean, median, standard deviation, and other descriptive statistics for numeric features.
2. Visualize Distributions
Use histograms and boxplots to understand the distribution and detect outliers in your data.
3. Feature Relationships
Use pairplots or a correlation matrix to see how features relate to each other.
4.Identify Patterns & Anomalies
Look for trends, clusters, or unusual values in your visualizations.
5. Feature-Level Insights
Make basic inferences from your plots and statistics to guide further analysis or preprocessing.
